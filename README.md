# -Image-style-transfer

# Description:
Image style transfer is the process of combining the content of one image with the style of another using a deep neural network. This project implements a basic Neural Style Transfer using a pre-trained VGG19 model from Keras to create stylized images.

# üñºÔ∏è What This Project Demonstrates:
* Transfers artistic style from one image to another

* Uses pre-trained VGG19 for feature extraction

* Balances content loss and style loss to create stylized output
